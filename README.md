Meet TravelPal, a chat app that performs end to end translation to assist travellers. 
Built on the Android platform, TravelPal gives you the ability to speak another language without learning one by translating your messages in real-time.
 Simply set up a TravelPal chat with someone who speaks another language and start chatting.

Not just your translator  this application is a multi-lingual guide
 
Wait, there's more - TravelPal can be your best companion when you travel abroad. It lets you chat with the locals nearby without you having to know their language.
Say, I am at Madrid Metro trying to figure out where the nearest cafe is but no-one speaks English there. I fire up TravelPal, look for locals nearby and ask for directions to the cafe.
When you use TravelPal:

✔ Your conversation is translated into another language in near real-time. 

✔ What someone else says is translated back in your language. 

✔ And you can send instant messages across 40+ languages.
